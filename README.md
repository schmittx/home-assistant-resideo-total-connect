# Resideo Total Connect Home Assistant Integration
Custom component to allow control of Resideo Total Connect devices in [Home Assistant](https://home-assistant.io).

## Credit
- This is a lightly modified version of the existing Home Assistant core integration with tweaks for my specific situation and usage.

## Install
1. Ensure Home Assistant is updated to version 2024.5.0 or newer.
2. Use HACS and add as a [custom repo](https://hacs.xyz/docs/faq/custom_repositories); or download and manually move to the `custom_components` folder.
3. Once the integration is installed follow the standard process to setup via UI and search for `Resideo Total Connect`.
4. Follow the prompts.
